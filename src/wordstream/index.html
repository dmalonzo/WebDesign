        <p>PPC- Achieve More Efficient Pay-Per-Clic (PPC) Marketing</p>

        <p>
            PPC (pay-per-click) search marketing software offers a means for accomplishing two core requirements for PPC
            optimizations.

            <ul>
                <li>PPC Automation - While it would be impossible (and inadvisable to automate every aspect of pay-per-click
                advertising, automating away redundant, time-consuming tasks affords you a means of increasing productivity.
                Often this means being able to produce an amount of work that would otherwise have been unachievable for you
                and your business</li>
                <li> PPC Management - PPC management refers to the maintenance and prioritization of paid search marketing
                tasts. Being able to oversee various aspects of your account while assigning each item on a seemingly endless
                to-do list an appropriate value can make or break an online ad campaign.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            WordStream's PPC software is specifically designed to aid in these two PPC search engine marketing areas. This page will show you both the processes the software is automating for you,
            and the best course of action to take where workflow is concerned.
